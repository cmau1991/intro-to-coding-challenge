# Challenge Description
# Write the pseudocode and create flowchart that finds the next ‘n’
# number of leap years from current year. Here ‘n’ is the input taken from user.
# This problem would require you to create two flowcharts, one demonstrating a function
# that tells you whether it is a year is leap year or not and the other to loop incrementally
# until you find next ‘n’ leap years.

#pseudocode:
# Read the number
# Create list to add leap years too
# Read second number and set a count to zero
# If 1st number is divisible by 400
# Year is a leap year and add to list
# add 1 to count
# Else If 1st number is divisible by 100
# Not a leap year and do not add to list
# Else if 1st number is divisible by 4
# Year is a leap year and add to list
# add 1 to count
# Else the year is not a leap year and do not add to list
# Repeat until the count equals the 2nd second number
# Print list of leap years from 1st number
