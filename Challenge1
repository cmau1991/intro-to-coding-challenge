# Challenge 5
# Find the second largest number in an array and demonstrate the workflow using
# pseudocode and flowchart.
# Example: Given an input array [45, 62, 8, 90, 13, 54, 7], the output should be 62.

# pseudocode:
# Create an empty array
# Read the number
# Append the entered number of random numbers into the array
# Determine the length of the array
# Locate the largest number in the array
# Print the array
# Print "Largest number in the given array is [ANSWER]".
