# Challenge 2
# Write the pseudocode and create a flowchart that demonstrate the workflow of
# identifying if a number is an Admirable number or not
# A whole number is admirable if the sum of proper divisors (excluding the number
# itself) minus two times one the proper divisors is equal to the number.
# Here’s an example- 30 is an admirable number because 1+2+3+5+6+10+15 – 2*6 = 30.
# Hint: This might require using two loop structures. You can of course choose to do it
# differently.

#pseudocode:
# Read the number
# if the number equals twice value of - the sum of all its divisors minus 2 times the proper divisor
# print "Yes, it is an Admirable number."
# else
# print "No, it is not an Admirable number."
