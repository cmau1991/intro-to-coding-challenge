# Challenge 4
# Show the workflow of removing all occurrences of a given character from the input
# string using pseudocode and flowchart.
# EXAMPLE: Removing all of the “s” from “Mississippi” will return “Miiippi”

# pseudocode:
# Read the word
# Read the letter to remove
# For every instance of the letter in word, replace with ' ' (empty space)
# print new word

pick_word = True
while pick_word:

    enter_word = str(input("What word would you like to use?"))
    choose_letter_to_remove = str(input("What letter would you like to remove from your chosen word?"))

    enter_word = enter_word.replace(choose_letter_to_remove, '')

    print(enter_word)

    new_word = input('Would you like to try a different word? (Y/N): ')

    if new_word.upper() != 'Y':
        pick_word = False
